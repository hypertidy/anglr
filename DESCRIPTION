Description: Gives direct access to generic 3D tools and provides a full suite 
 of mesh-creation and 3D plotting functions. By extending the 'rgl' package 
 conversion and visualization functions for the 'mesh3d' class a wide variety of
 complex spatial data can be brought into 3D scenes. These tools allow for 
 spatial raster, polygons, and lines that are common in 'GIS' contexts to be 
 converted into mesh forms with high flexibility and the ability to integrate 
 disparate data types. Vector and raster data can be seamlessly combined as 
 meshes, and surfaces can be set to have material properties based on data 
 values or with image textures. Textures and other data combinations use 
 projection transformations to map between coordinate systems, and objects can 
 be easily visualized in an interactive scene at any stage. This package relies 
 on the 'RTriangle' package for high-quality triangular meshing which is 
 licensed restrictively under 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0'.
